# My-To-Do-List-Website
I followed a YouTube video but also added my own features such as the clear all button

This is a basic to-do list web application that allows you to add, check, and remove tasks.

## Getting Started

1. Download or clone the project to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to use the application.

## Usage

### Adding a Task

- Type your task in the input box.
- Click the "Add" button or press Enter to add the task to the list.

### Marking a Task as Completed

- Click on a task to mark it as completed. It will be crossed out.

### Removing a Task

- Click on the "x" button next to a task to remove it from the list.

### Clearing All Tasks

- When tasks are added, the "Clear All" button appears.
- Click the "Clear All" button to remove all tasks from the list.

## Features

- Tasks are saved locally using the browser's `localStorage`, so they persist even if you close the browser.

## Contributing

This project is open for contributions. Feel free to fork the repository and make improvements.

## Acknowledgments

- Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Enjoy using your to-do list application!
